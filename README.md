# AutoClone
Python utility to automate copies, syncs, and moves performed by rclone. This tool will allow you to sync local files to remote cloud servers (like Google Drive, OneDrive and Amazon) and vice versa. The file transfers occur at custom intervals and the finished product will include some psuedo-machine learning, where the scripts are able to predict heavy usage periods for file directories and increase transfer intervals during these times.
